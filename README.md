# cla-to-mcr
By Pulin Agrawal
My project for conversion of CLA binary vectors to MCR vectors. Checks if the distances are preserved.

For reverse translation
 Probing can be used to probe if the given MCR vector has some set of Projection MCR vector vectors. by placing 1's on the positions of those vectors we can retrieve the CLA vector.

Sparse binary vectors are noise robust. 
MCR vectors provide composition capabilities.
Possible Applications 
    Sparse PCA
    Sparse Composite Quantization
